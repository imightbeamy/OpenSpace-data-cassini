   This directory contains files that originally resided in the CASSINI
   ops SPK directory (the "parent" of this one.) The files were moved 
   out of the ops area for a numbers of reasons -- became obsolete, were
   superseded by newer versions, were used in a merged product that is
   available in the ops area, etc. Independently of the reasons why they
   were moved, the files located in this directory and its subdirectories
   should NOT be copied from it (them) and used in any applications.
