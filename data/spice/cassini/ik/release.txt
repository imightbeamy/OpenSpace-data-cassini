current: (cas_v40.tf)
   Date: November 7, 2008
   Notes:
     --   Added name/ID mapping, FOV, and other parameters for
          CASSINI_UVIS_SOL_OFF/-82849 to UVIS IK. New instrument 
          kernel: cas_uvis_v06.ti.

     --   Added CASSINI_UVIS_SOL_OFF frame, ID -82849 to 
          main FK file. New frame kernel: cas_v40.tf.

release.13: (cas_v39.tf)
   Date: Oct 19, 2004
   Notes:
     --   Updated UVIS_EUV, UVIS_FUV and UVIS_HSP frames for slightly
          modified boresight vectors. The instrument "Y" axis has 
          also been determined to point along the spacecraft -Z direction
          instead of + Z. Change is effective beginning at: TIME:
          2002-266T00:00:00.000 New frame kernel: cas_v39.tf.
   
   Date: Dec 5, 2005
   Notes:
     --   Updated description of the INS[#]_FOV_CENTER_PIXEL keyword
          and the pixel layouts in ISS IK. No data are changed.

release.12 (cas_v38.tf)
   Date: May 10, 2004
   Notes:
     --  Modified CASSINI_KABAND  (and therefor CASSINI_XBAND)
         frame definition to reflect new RSS pointing information. New
         frame kernel: cas_v38.tf.

release.11 (cas_v37.tf)
   Date: November 20, 2003
   Notes:
     --  Modified CASSINI_KABAND  (and therefor CASSINI_XBAND)
         frame definition to reflect new RSS pointing information. New
         frame kernel: cas_v37.tf.

release.10 (cas_v36.tf)

   Date: January  23, 2004
   Notes:
     --  Updated ISS focal lengths using inflight calibration results.

release.09 (cas_v35.tf)

   Date: April 18, 2003
   Notes:
    -- Added a new instrument, X BAND TRUE, that contains the old X
       BAND instrument FOV definitions. Altered X BAND definitions
       so that they are the same as Ka band. This is necessary
       because of the way that the uplink software uses the
       information. See the updated frame kernel for more
       information. The ID for X BAND TRUE is -82186, the name is
       CASSINI_RSS_HGA_X_TRUE.

release.08 (cas_v34.tf)

   Date: October 7, 2002
   Notes:
    -- Updated VIMS radiator FOV reference angle from 90 to 82 degrees.

release.07: (cas_v33.tf)

   Date: June 11, 2002
   Notes:
    -- Updated CASSINI_CIRS_FP3, CASSINI_CIRS_FP4, and CASSINI_CIRS_FPB 
       field of view definitions in cas_cirs_v09.ti.  These updates 
       reflect a base pixel size of 0.3 milliradians square (as opposed 
       to the 0.294 milliradian value used previously) and the updates
       for offsets of the FP3 and FP4 boresights from FPB.

release.06: (cas_v32.tf)

   Date: March 12, 2002
   Notes:
    -- Added CASSINI_CIRS_FPB mode timing keywords to cas_cirs_v08.ti.

release.05: (cas_v31.tf)

   Date: February 20, 2002
   Notes:
    -- The updated frame kernel should be used with this I-kernel set.

   Date: January 28, 2002
   Notes:
    -- Added CASSINI_CIRS_FPB FOV definition to cas_cirs_v07.ti.
    -- Corrected CASSINI_CIRS_FP3 and CASSINI_CIRS_FP4 FOV definitions.
    -- N0052 is now available, and users requiring GETFOV or getfov_c 
       should update their toolkit installations.

release.04: (cas_v30.tf)

   Date: August 9, 2001
   Notes:
    -- The updated frame kernel should be used with this I-kernel set.

   Date: May 4, 2001
   Notes:
    -- Updated all I-kernel FOV definitions to utilize the new ANGLES spec.
       To use GETFOV with these FOV definitions requires the N0052 version
       of GETFOV.  Contact Scott Turner (sturner@spice.jpl.nasa.gov) to
       obtain a pre-release version.  N0052 is scheduled for delivery to 
       the Cassini project the first week of July 2001.
    -- Added the SRU I-kernel.
    -- Minor documentation updates and corrections.

    -- Updates to INMS and RSS I-kernel as a result of kernel review.

release.02: (cas_v28.tf)

   Date: October 11, 2000
   Notes:
    -- First official kernel release for instrument team review.
   
release.01: (cas_v27.tf)
